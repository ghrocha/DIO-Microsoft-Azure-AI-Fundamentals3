I’m sad to say, this will be my last stay at Augusto’s.
I have stayed at Augustos many times since 2016. It was my favorite place in Rio. This is my first trip back post Covid pandemic and I was so disappointed. The beds throughout numerous rooms were very uncomfortable. In two rooms the air conditioner did not work. The Wi-Fi is very spotting requiring guest to huddle in the lobby to use it. The location is great, a short walk to Copacabana beach, numerous shops and restaurants
Bad Wifi
Terrible beds
Non working AC
