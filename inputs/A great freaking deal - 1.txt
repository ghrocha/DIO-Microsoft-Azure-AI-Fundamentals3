A great freaking deal
This place was great! For the value it was incredible. The bathroom had a vanity for ALL my stuff, not just some tiny sink with nowhere to put anything. The TV worked, the fridge worked, the A/C worked. The bed was good enough, everything was clean. The gym had handweights. I looked at photos of many hotels with gyms, most didn't show handweights, which is a must form me. The others probably had handweights, but did not show them in the photos. The breakfast was really nice, it was the same every day for the most part, but good enough for me. It had eggs, some type of sausages (not american sausage, but different every day) There were many kinds of breads (always in South America) but there was wheat bread for wheat toast, there were pancakes, lunchmeats, cheese, fruit, coffee with leche....It was a good thing. There was unsalted butter. The location was really nice, however upon my return I would like the hotel to move itself to a location near lagoa. It is 4-5 blocks from Copacabana/Leme beach. There was several grocery stores, ATM's and a coffee shop within blocks. THere ia a bike station across the street.
I could have used some hangers, like at least 10 of them. I wish you could have a microwave, but for the price I'm okay with not having one. There wasn't that many Power outlets, good thing I carry a power converter that allow me to plug in 8 devices at once. THe internet was okay, but when I tried to use netflix on my laptop it dogged out, I also had to pay bills while there and the internet kept dropping off. However, it is as good as any other internet in this part of the world. I did watch Netflix on my phone and that seemed to work for the most part. The TV did have channels in english, but depends if that's what you like to watch.
