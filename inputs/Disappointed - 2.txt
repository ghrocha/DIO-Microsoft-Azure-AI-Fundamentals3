Disappointed
The staff was friendly and helpful.
Who decides the number of stars a hotel deserves? My room had a dirty floor. The air conditioning made as much noise as a jet airplane. In addition the noise from the street was insane. The breakfast was very standard. To summarize; Not worth the money!
